A small python library, which implements the MyProxy protocol (http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/protocol).

The module ships also a myproxyclient.py (equivalent of myproxy-logon in java), that uses
the library to up- and download myproxy credentials from a myproxy server.

Please take also a look at the NOTES file, which is shipped together with the sources.
