Some notes concerning the myproxy library
----------------------------------------

The library does not implement the entire myproxy protocol
as specified at http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/protocol.

Currently only the 'put' and 'get' methods of the protocol 
have been implemented.

Notes on the 'put' method: 
-------------------------

When 'put'ing a local grid certificate to the myproxy server 
the library creates a local proxy certificate which is used
to sign the CSR received by the myproxy server. 

One can only specify the key length of the proxy certificate
that is used to sign the CSR. All other key lenghts are fixed
by the myproxy server. 

The put method allows allows uploading certificates of the 
types:  old (old style proxy) and rfc (rfc 3820 proxies) 
and to optionaly specify whether the policy of the proxy 
shall be set to 'limited'. 

Mixed remarks:
-------------

It seems that old style limited proxies can correclty be up-
and downloaded (put/get methods), but a downloaded limited
proxy can't be used to fetch the VOMS credentials for the
user.
